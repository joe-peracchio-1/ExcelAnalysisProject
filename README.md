# ExcelAnalysisProject
Small repository to clean and create subsets of data for further analysis.

This was a small project for a company that I worked with over the summer.
The script uses pandas and Tkinter to create an interface for cleaning and creating data subsets of an excel file. 
There are four different modes that can be used: Data Cleaner, Data Subset, Text Present, and Text Instance.
Data Cleaner will remove certain values from a column in an excel file and write to a new, user-specified file with the changes.
Data Subset counts the matching values in a column and can continue for as long as the user wants as long as specified. The result is printed to an output text file.
Text Present will check if a string appears in a cell and prints out the entire cell to an output text file.
Text Instance will check if a string appears in a cell and counts the instances. The result is printed to an output text file.

Please provide any suggestions to make the program better. Thank you
